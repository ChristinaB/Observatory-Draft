# Observatory
Tools for observing the terrestrial and aquatic surfaces of Earth 

“Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it.” Bruce Lee

An observatory is a location used for observing terrestrial or celestial events (thank you Wikipedia). Observatories have been as simple as containing an astronomical sextant, and as complicated as modern academic supported observatories containing multi-million dollar instruments, tools, with institutions supporting long term research and education programs.  While observatories are usually thought of as star-gazing investments in the field of astronomy, observatories have also been constructed in climatology/meteorology, geophysical, oceanography and volcanology communities, in order to investigate and coordinate their research efforts.  

This repository is intended for the sharing and distribution of open-source Python based code useful for model and data integration that improves access to large datasets, reduces computational burden, reinvent the wheel less often, and share and communicate more about how to synthesize earth surface observations in useful ways.

0) Make a fork of ChristinaB/Observatory
1) In HydroShare, get to JupyterHub and open up a terminal instance.
2) Change the working directory to notebooks
3) type in "git clone <github link>", where the github link should be available https://github.com/ChristinaB/Observatory.git
4) then type in your github username and password to then download the git clone.
5) you should now have notebooks/Observatory subdirectory with this README.md and the observatory_gridded_hydrometeorology.py (OGH) within.

6) any changes made to the OGH should be saved.
7) at the end of the session, open up the JupyterHub terminal and "cd notebook/Observatory"
8) type in "git status" to identify all the changes made to the git repository files
9) type in "git add <nameoffile>", where name of file is observatory_gridded_hydrometeorology.py
10) Once all updates have been "git added", then type in "git commit" to acknowledge the changes.
11) Now, type in "git push"

12) Finally, do a "git pull" to send a pull request for pulling the branch into the master.
