# Observatory
Tools for observing the terrestrial and aquatic surfaces of Earth 

“Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it.” Bruce Lee

An observatory is a location used for observing terrestrial or celestial events (thank you Wikipedeia). Observatories have been as simple as containing an astronomical sextant, and as complicated as modern academic supported observatories containing multi-million dollar instruments, tools, and institutions supporting long term research and education.  While observatories are usually thought of as star-gazing investments in the field of astronomy, observatories have also been constructed in climatology/meteorology, geophysical, oceanography and volcanology communities, in order to investigate and coordinate their research efforts.  

This repository is intended for the sharing and distribution of open-source Python based code useful for model and data integration that improves access to large datasets, reduces computational burden, reinvent the wheel less often, and share and communicate more about how to synthesize earth surface observations in useful ways.
